# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI — A Very Basic Game with an Unbeatable AI!

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**, a simple yet classic game where you can challenge an unbeatable AI (well, *almost* unbeatable) in the good ol' game of X's and O's. It's perfect for passing time or flexing your coding muscles on AI logic!

🤖 **Spoiler Alert:** The AI doesn't like losing (it's using the minimax algorithm), so get ready for a real challenge!

## 🚀 Features
- **Play Tic-Tac-Toe** against a very basic yet smart AI.
- **AI that can't be beaten** (seriously, it's using the minimax algorithm—it's got the game figured out).
- **A super simple interface** built with Tkinter (hey, it's old-school but it works!).
- **Automatic game results:** whether you win (good luck), lose (more likely), or draw (a sign of progress)!
- **Restart the game** anytime and try again (because we believe in second chances).

## 🎯 What's the Goal?
The game is simple: get three of your marks (X's or O's) in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before the AI does. And trust us, the AI is *really* good at this game.
